## Test directory
To run small test programs, edit the *demo.asm* file. You
can compile with *make* and run your test with *make run*.
You can either reimplement your tested programs and 
commit to master branch or clean up your test directory
by running the command *make clean* which moves the
old demo file to *old/* and creates a new file with some
boilerplate for you.
