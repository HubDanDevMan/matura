# Glossary
The world of computers is a fascinating but vast world. 
There are many different concepts in computer science
and all of them are named. Here are some of the most frequently

| Term | Explanation |
| ---- | ---- |
| Hardware | Physical device/part of a computer. Examples are: <br/> -processor (CPU) -harddisk -keyboard -mouse |
| Software | Instructions and data for a computer. It is sometimes referred to as *program* <br /> A computer is ***made*** of *hardware* that can ***execute*** *software*. |
| Programming language | *Human readable*, formal language that allows programmers to write software. <br/> It can not be executed by a computer directly. <br/> Examples of programming languages are C, Java and Python |
| Machine code | *Processor readable* translation of a programming language. It is humanly unreadable <br/> because it is does not use characters but rather binary CPU instructions. |
| Compiler | A program that translates a programming language into machine code |
| CPU instructions | The most fundamental, simple operations that can be done by a processor (addition, multiplication, binary-xor) <br/> They are encoded in bytes and can be multiple bytes long. More in chapter "The CPU" |
| Operating system (OS) | A program that manages the hardware and provides resource sharing and a layer of abstraction <br/> for application programs. Examples of OSes are Windows 10, MacOS, Android and Ubuntu. <br/> Because operating systems are the central part of our project, we have dedicated an entire chapter (What is an OS?) to it. |
