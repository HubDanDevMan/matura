# Processes

A process is defined as a computer program that is currently being executed. A program is a 
series of instructions and static data that are stored as a file on a disc. The instructions
by themselves do nothing, the bytes must first be transformed by the operating system into 
something usable for the CPU. When a program is loaded into memory it becomes a process and 
this can be generalized into four sections:

- The Stack:

The stack contains a data such as method parameters, local variables and return adresses. The stack is use for temporary data.
- The Heap:

The heap contains Memory that is dynamically allocated during the run time of the process.
- The Data

The data is the section containing the static and global variables.
- The Text

The text contains the current activity, this is represented by the value of the program counter it also contains the contents of the processor's registers.

Further iformation on these four sections can be found within the memory chapter.
