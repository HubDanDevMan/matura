\section{Reflection}

In hindsight, we realized that our advisors Dr. Palfinger and Dr. Bersier were right; creating 
an operating system from scratch is \textbf{hard}. In modern programming languages you have a
lot of safety nets that will save you from making mistakes and assembly has none of these nets.
Assembly is a programming language that is very close to the hardware which further distances 
the code from the actual function of the written code. There are times when we have hit
walls that simply needed time to overcome because finding the nature of a problem in assembly
is not easy. Often we had to take three steps back to take one forward, even starting anew on
a program to gain a new perspective on a problem that seemed unsolvable. Assembly programming 
can be seen as operating on a black box, you get no information on what your program does or
what's wrong with it, you simply have to look at the code long enough until you find the problem.
But as is with all programming languages over time you get better at this kind of problem solving.
But even with all the adversities that came along with OS developement we are glad that we took up
the challenge because we have gained profound insight on computers and programming. All this
newfound knowledge can be used in high-level programming languages. Despite the hardships we have 
faced, we are glad that we took up this endeavor and we will keep working on this project as we please.
