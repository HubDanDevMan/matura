\section{code}

This project was written in \textit{x86 assembly language}. This is
due to the fine grained control that we need to manipulate memory and
the difficulty. Working on direct hardware means that there are no functions such as \texttt{printf} or \texttt{scanf}. There is also no
\textit{standard library} as known from programming regular applications for operating systems with languages such as C. Many
functions that are known from the C standard library had to be implemented from scratch for this project.
