| 17. March  | ***All***: On Wednesday we had our first meeting with our advisor, Mr. Palfinger, where we discussed the proceedings that will follow. We structured the approach of our project, deciding who makes what for the next few days.<br>***Daniel***: I wrote a boot loader for the OS so that we can start developing other programs. Because I have written multiple boot loaders in the past, this task was not that difficult. But for the first time, I have really tried to integrate error handling. I also read and studied the NASM docs, especially chapter NASM macros. On top of that, I started to write 3 print functions namely for Null-terminated Strings, hexadecimal numbers and signed decimal numbers.<br> ***Nick***: I read more about the components of operating systems and the different types of operating systems. To start practicing I downloaded Oracle VM to install Manjaro, which is an operating system based on Arch Linux.<br>***Moray***: Simple pixel print macro written for graphics rendering, the program by printing pixels at an x, y coordinate. The program then proceeds to increment the coordinates to fill a rectangle in the desired size. Research in Intel Docs and other x86 assembly sources. 
| 24. March | ***All***: We made sure our work environments are all up to date and working correctly and adding the missing programs. We decided to use a makefile to simplify the compilation process.<br>***Daniel***: I finished the print functions and reworked the boot loader and tried to make the code more readable. I tried to implement an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) for 0 Division Exceptions, but I encountered very weird bugs where the wrong effective address was written into the Interrupt Vector Table. I did not add it to my master branch for that reason. Wrote the makefile with targets all and run, the latter starting QEMU with the right parameters and running the OS.<br>***Nick***: I started reading the NASM docs and studied code of different open-source programs to deepen my understanding of assembly language.<br>***Moray***: Expanded on the pixel print macro by creating a 4-bit colored painting program with cursor to test aspects of the expanded macro. The program runs in VGA graphics mode and uses the aforementioned pixel print macro as a base for painting. At the time the program cannot save the drawn picture. |
| 31. March | ***All***: On 31. March, we met again with our advisor and discussed the terms of the contract. We then tried to fix the missing parts and reworked faulty statements. We are spending a lot of time reading Intel's manuals and reading NASM docs.<br>***Daniel***: Finally, I was able to find the bug in the interrupt handler. NASM calculated the wrong offset and loaded the wrong function pointer to the IVT. I had to debug using hex dump and looking through the machine code. I have written a macro that makes adding new IVT entries a lot more readable. The error was caused by compile time vs preprocessor time discrepancies. I started to write some documentation and texts about OSes and lower level computing. <br>***Nick***: I invested time in reading more about interrupts and studying program flow control. I want to continue my research and start creating small test programs next week.<br>***Moray***: Bug found in painting program it only allows a certain number of colors to be added. Looking for a fix of the bug. |
| 7. April | ***All***: We discussed the terms of the contract one last time and then we signed it. After careful consideration, we decided to use version control for working together more easily. Git seemed like a good option because it is very common. We spend a lot of time learning git to make sure we don’t mess up our repo. <br>***Daniel***: I created the GitHub repo and cleaned up the makefiles within the different subdirectories and I refurbished the directory structure. I read up on exception interrupts vs the 8259-chip generated interrupts. I was confused how both interrupts are hardware generated because I thought they would run the same ISR. Now I know that the 8259 can be reprogrammed to remap interrupt handlers. <br>***Nick***: I continued my research on assembly language and read more about memory addressing. I learned how to use NASM and QEMU. After that I started making small and simple programs to practice. I would like to make a very simple game to practice. In the holidays I will continue my research so that I can start making programs for our OS. <br>***Moray***: Started research on how to do string comparisons. Created new string comprison macro file that compares strings at given pointers. Uploaded string comparison macro and drawsquare macro files to GitHub repo. Both files require the firststage file in order to work, this file was also uploaded to GitHub repo. |
| 10. April - 24. April | ***All***: During the spring break we didn't work on our OS, but we each continued our research. <br>***Daniel***: I read a lot about the PIC and how to configure it. The PIC is a chip that allows hardware interrupts to be configured properly. I also looked for docs about the various timers and clocks on a PC system. I will try to configure the RealTimeClock to regularly create an interrupt just to learn how it works. I have not found a lot of time for coding because I was working during my holidays. <br>***Nick***: In the last two weeks I continued to read the NASM docs. <br>***Moray***: I started research into how the painting program can be made to work with video memory directly to make it faster and also add the possibility to add ASCII letters.
| 28. April | ***All***: <br>***Daniel***: <br>***Nick***: I read up on the CPUID instruction which allows software to report details from the processor. This is useful to get an overview on the processers state. <br>***Moray***: I created a function that prints out all general purpose registers, segmented registers and the flags in hexadecimal onto a video memory array. The programm still needs some programming to be done as the flags arent printed in manner that can be read and there are no labels yet. <br> |
