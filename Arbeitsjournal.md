| 17. March  | ***All***: On Wednesday we had our first meeting with our advisor, Mr. Palfinger, where we discussed the proceedings that will follow. We structured the approach of our project, deciding who makes what for the next few days.<br>***Daniel***: I wrote a bootloader for the OS so that we can start developing other programs. Because I have written multiple bootloaders in the past, this task was not that difficult. But for the first time, I have really tried to integrate error handling. I also read and studied the NASM docs, especially chapter NASM macros. On top of that, I started to write 3 print functions namely for Null-terminated Strings, hexadecimal numbers and signed decimal numbers.<br> ***Nick***:I read more about the components of operating systems and the different types of operating systems. To start practicing I downloaded Oracle VM to install Manjaro which is an operating system based on Arch Linux.<br>***Moray***: Simple pixel print macro written for graphics rendering, the program by printing pixels at an x, y coordinate. The program then proceeds to increment the coordinates to fill a rectangle in the desired size. Research in Intel Docs and other x86 assembly sources. 
| 24. March | ***All***: We made sure our work environments are all up to date and working correctly and adding the missing programs. We decided to use a Makefile to simplify the compilation process.<br>***Daniel***: I finished the print functions and reworked the Bootloader and tried to make the code more readable. I tried to implement an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) for 0 Division Exceptions, but I encountered very weird bugs where the wrong effective address was written into the Interrupt Vector Table. I did not add it to my master branch for that reason. Wrote the Makefile with targets all and run, the latter starting QEMU with the right parameters and running the OS.<br>***Nick***: I started reading the NASM docs and studied code of different open-source programs to deepen my understanding of assembly language.<br>***Moray***: Expanded on the pixel print macro by creating a 4-bit coloured painting program with cursor to test aspects of the expanded macro. The program runs in VGA graphics mode and uses the aforementioned pixel print macro as a base for painting. At the time the program cannot save the drawn picture. |
| 31. March | ***All***: On 31. March, we met again with our advisor and acknowledged the criticism. We then tried to fix the missing parts and reworked faulty statements. We are spending a lot of time reading Intel's manuals and reading NASM docs.<br>***Daniel***: Finally, I was able to find the bug in the interrupt handler. NASM calculated the wrong offset and loaded the wrong function pointer to the IVT. I had to debug using hexdump and looking through the machine code. I have written a macro that makes adding new IVT entries a lot more readable. The error was caused by compile time vs pre-processor time discrepancies. I started to write some documentation and texts about OSes and lower level computing. <br>***Nick***: I read more about the components of an operating systems and the different types of operating systems. To start practicing I downloaded Oracle VM to install Manjaro which is an operating system based on Arch Linux.<br>***Moray***: Bug found in painting program it only allows a certain  amount of colours to be added. Looking for a fix of the bug. |
