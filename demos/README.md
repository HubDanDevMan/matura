# Demo directory
This directory contains various small programms that have not been fully
integrated to FlamingOS. They mostly consist of a firststage bootloader
and the main file but may contain additional macrofiles or asm files
with functions. This directory is where *successful* test files reside.

To assemble a demo type `make IF=DIRECTORYNAME` or additionly `run`
to test it out immediatly.

These files may be incorporated later but are currently for show-off.
