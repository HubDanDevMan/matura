### Preamble

We are students of Kantonsschule in Baden (CH) and this is our
Maturaarbeit(MA). A MA is a graded task where students plan and
create their own project that they will (hopefully) accomplish
within ~9 Months. The project should pose a challenge to students
and most importantly result in skill improvements such as
- General project management
- Time management
- Team work and coordination
- Complience with school and scientific guidelines
- Endurance
We decided to create an operating system not only because it is
difficult but also because we are genuinly curious in learning
more about the technologies we treat as "black boxes" but use
every day.
We hope that this project inspires technology enthusiasts to
create their own projects and for readers to learn something
about operating systems.

| lib/ | Various functions to be used in dynamic linking of programms |
| macros/ | Includes various macros to make code more readable <br /> and less repetitive |
| test/ | Test file with debug functions and build file to quickly test and debug code |
| demos/ | Finished test programs that fulfill their purpose (e.g. graphics rendering, sound generator) |
| Makefile | File to build source. See [Build](##Build) |
| README.md | This file |
| LICENSE | Full license text |
| Conventions.md | Guide for readable and elegant code |
| Arbeitsjournal.md | Weekly student's work log of this project |

### Build ##
To compile, go into the top level directory and type `Make`.
If you want to run the OS directly in QEMU (virtual machine)
type `Make run`.
Cleaning is not really necessary, because there is no use of
header files in assembly language. There are also no intermediate
build files.
